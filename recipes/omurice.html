        <h3>Procedures</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Chop up the onions into rings and throw them into the pan to glaze them in medium heat. Add soy sauce, a tiny amount of salt ( or even no salt since soy sauce is already salty), and some pepper as the onions cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add finely diced garlic before the onions cook up. Then add in your green onions and some butter.
            </li>

            <li>
                Dice your chickens into small or medium sized cubes and add them to the pan.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wait until chickens are no longer pink before adding your rice.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add some more butter as well as tomato paste and Sriaracha as needed. Add more soy sauce to enhance flavour until satisfactory.
            </li>

            <li>Put serving on plate once rice is fried well.</li>

            <li>
                Now the most important part: <b>THE OMLETTE</b>. Sadly I have a 6% winrate on this so you're gonna have to search up a tutorial on this.
            </li>

            <li>Done!</li>
